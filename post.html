                        <p>I began my journey in the sunny shores of Huntington Beach, California, where I took my first breath on February 20th, 2001, surrounded by the gentle roar of the Pacific Ocean. However, my early years were not solely spent in the Golden State, as my family soon relocated to Oceanport, New Jersey, just two and a half years later. It was in the quaint charm of New Jersey where I spent the formative years of my childhood, forging friendships, exploring the East Coast, and embracing the seasonal rhythms of life.</p>
                        <p>Yet, the call of the West eventually beckoned my family back to our roots in Huntington Beach, where I completed my final two years of high school. It was amidst the vibrant culture and coastal beauty of California that I cultivated my aspirations, eventually leading me to embark on my collegiate journey at BYU.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">My Dog - Buzz</h2>
                        <p>Meet Buzz, the furry companion who has been by my side through thick and thin. A delightful mix of poodle and Bichon Frise, Buzz came into our lives when I was just 8 years old, back in our New Jersey days. Serendipity smiled upon us when my dad's friend had an abundance of puppies from a breeding, and Buzz became an instant member of our family. Inspired by my childhood fascination with Buzz Lightyear, we christened him with a name that seemed to fit his adventurous spirit perfectly. Now, at the ripe age of 15, with his 16th birthday on the horizon in August, Buzz has grown alongside me, offering unconditional love, boundless joy, and unwavering loyalty. He's more than just a pet; he's a cherished companion, a steadfast friend, and a constant source of comfort in a world that's always changing.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">My Family</h2>
                        <p>My family is the cornerstone of my life, a source of unwavering love and support that has shaped me into the person I am today. At its helm are my loving mom and dad, whose guidance and encouragement have been constants through every triumph and challenge. Alongside them is my older sister, who I've looked up to and shared countless memories with over the years. Her marriage a few years ago introduced me to a new brother-in-law, adding another cherished member to our tight-knit clan.</p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>
                        <p>While our roots are in New Jersey, where most of my family resides, our bonds extend far beyond geographical boundaries. In the Garden State, I'm surrounded by grandparents, aunts, uncles, and a plethora of cousins, forming a vibrant tapestry of love, laughter, and lifelong connections that I hold dear to my heart.</p>
